# About Atom-ng
Atom-ng is a fork of Atom, maintained by me, with updated dependencies, compiler optimizations (in Electron too!), added packages, fixes, 
and distribution nice-haves (like using it portably, see below). 

## Portable Atom-ng Usage
--------------------------------

## Linux
If you are using Linux, then you can run ATOM-NG_PORTABLE in this dir to run Atom-ng Portably. Your atom-ng user data will be in `.atom` and your 
electron user data will be in `.atom/electronUserData` 

## Windows
If you are using Windows, then you can run ATOM-NG_PORTABLE.bat in this dir to run Atom-ng Portably. Your atom-ng user data will be in `.atom` and your 
electron user data will be in `.atom\electronUserData` 

## Notes
NOTE: Once your portable user data dir is set up, you don't need to run the portable executable/bat file (you can just run `atom-ng`). 
However if you delete or move it you will need to run it again.
